<p  align="center">📝 Modern To-Do List App</p>

This project is a simple yet powerful Modern To-Do List App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I created this project while learning JavaScript fundamentals to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage, and dynamic element creation in a real-world mini project.


🚀 Features

✅ Add new tasks dynamically with one click.

✅ Delete tasks individually with a delete button.

✅ Tasks are saved automatically using localStorage — even after page refresh.


✅ Prevents duplicate tasks.

✅ Beautiful, modern UI with glassmorphism and gradient background.

✅ Smooth hover animations for buttons and task items.

🎯 Purpose Behind This Project

At the beginning of my JavaScript learning journey, I strongly believed in building mini projects to apply what I learned practically. 💻

This project reflects my early hands-on practice where I explored:

🔹 DOM Selection & Manipulation

🔹 Event Listeners and Event Handling

🔹 Saving and Retrieving Data from localStorage

🔹 Creating and Deleting Dynamic Elements

🔹 Modern CSS Styling (Gradients, Glassmorphism, Animations)

Even though it's a small project, it has been a huge milestone in improving my real coding skills! 🚀✨
